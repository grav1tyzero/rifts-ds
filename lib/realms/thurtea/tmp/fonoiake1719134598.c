A large oaken table holds magical artifacts, each with its own story. A massive bookshelf covers one wall, filled with tomes of ancient knowledge from countless dimensions. A large magic circle in the room’s center serves as the site for opening rifts, the air around it crackling with residual energy. Despite the mystical atmosphere, there are touches of comfort: a plush chair by the fire and a small bed in one corner.");
